       //for eg:
       let team_name = String::from("Green");
       scores.insert(team_name, 20);

        //println!("accessing team_name that wa just moved: {team_name}");//can't to this
        //we can use reference though.

        //updating in hashmap
        //we might want to update the value associated with certain key.

        //overwriting a value.
        //if we insert again with the key that is already in the map, then old value is overwritten.


        //Adding a Key and Value Only If a Key Isnâ€™t Present
        //here we check if the key is present if yes we do nothing 
        //if no then we add key with new value

        //The return value of the entry method is an enum called Entry that represents a value that might or might not exist.
        //or_insert is the method from a Entry enum, it returns the mutable reference for the  key if the key exists in the map 
        //and if the key doesn't exists it inserts the param as the new value for the key.


        //UPDATING A VALUE BASED ON THE OLD VALUE(LIKE COUNTING FREQUENCY)
