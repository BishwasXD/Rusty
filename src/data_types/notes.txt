1. Different types of formatters:

a) {} -> these type of formatter are used for formatting user centric output such as string, number, float etc. which normal user sees
         and can understand what it is actually is.

         eg: like formatting for name, age, address, today's temperature.

b) {:?} -> these type of formatter are developers centric and use to format datas not understood by normal users, mainly used for debugging
           purpose.

           eg: array, memory address, structure etc..
