File to write some newbie shit for personal shit
This is for reference purposes 

create a project with cargo ---> cargo new ProjectName

rustc main.rs
  ./main.exe

cargo build
builds inside target\debug

cargo run
build and run executable

cargo build --release
for final build with optimization takes long to compile


cargo check ---> check for problems but doesnot compile the code so faster

rustfmt nameOffile.rs(in cmd) 
format your rust code

mod.rs
-> When you have a directory in rust, you have bunch of sub_modules in it, by declaring those sub_modules in mod.rs it serves as a entry point to the module. 
-> we can do the similar operation without using mod.rs as well



Shallow Copy: shallow copy copies the reference of a data. modifying one data will affect other data as well, however in case of rust the concept of shallow 
              copy works differently, while using shallow copy in rust the ownernship of data is transfered to other data, only one copy of data is maintained in 
              the heap. and only new owner is accessible.
             
Deep Copy: In deep copy new heap will be allocated for the other data, now both the data are independent and both are the owner. modifying one data will not change the 
           other data.

          -> program execution in ownernship.rs
