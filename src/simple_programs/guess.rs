//standard(std) input output(io) library
// By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it
//brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the prelude, and
//you can see everything in it at
//*https:doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.xhtml.
//If a type you want to use isnâ€™t in the prelude, you have to bring that type
//into scope explicitly with a use statement.
//use rand as dependency in cargo.toml to use
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

//cargo doc --open
//creates local documentation for the cargo and opens in browser
